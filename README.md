Shortest-Cheapest-Route
=======================

This is a program written in C++ for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at UF. The program uses an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest or cheapest path between two cities. There is no menu, and the program must be run directly from the command line with the proper arguments. In order to run the program use the following code in the command line once the project is compiled:  ./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv OutputName.html Origin(Country Name) Destination(Other Country Name) Cheapest(or Fastest)

Examples:
./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv sampleOutputItalyKazakhstanCheapest.html Italy Kazakhstan cheapest 
./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv sampleOutputItalyKazakhstanFastest.html Italy Kazakhstan fastest 
./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv sampleOutputParaguayGuatemalaCheapest.html Paraguay Guatemala cheapest 
./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv sampleOutputPortugalIcelandCheapest.html Portugal Iceland cheapest 

Note that airplanes are only taken if they are the only option available to a traveler.
